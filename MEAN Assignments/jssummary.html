    <h1>Different methods for constructing objects</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>An object has private and public variables nad methods.</li>
      <li>The methods can either be inside the object contructor scope, or it can be a function outside the scope of said constructor.</li>
      <li>If it is a object constructor, the first letter of the function will be capitalized, and you will instantiate it with new.</li>
      <li>You can use prototype for functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What is the role of the this and new?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Two keywords that are used to expedite functions to generate objects.</li>
      <li>We can also eliminate the use of the object var and return.</li>
      <li>To instantiate place new before the function.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What is scope?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Scope is a set of variables you have access too.</li>
      <li>Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.  Local variables have local scope:
      They can only be accessed within the function.</li>
      <li>A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.  A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions
      on a web page can access it. </li>
      <li>If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable, even
      if the value is assigned inside a function.</li>
      <li>With JavaScript, the global scope is the complete JavaScript environment.  In HTML, the global scope is the window
      object. All global variables belong to the window object.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>How prototyping helps make a program more efficient?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>prototype - how objects in JavaScript share properties and methods.</li>
      <li>vars from the same object constructor can share the same functions through prototype.</li>
      <li>It makes programming more efficiant but not needing to write out the whole function when you want it invoked.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>List some things that werenâ€™t quite clear and ask those around you for clarification</h1>

            <p>Hi!  My name is Ricardo.  I have been working in full service industry kitchens for 15 years, and have been working
            as a Sous Chef for the past 4 years.  My brother has been coding for about 10 years now, and has finally convinved
            to go ahead and start coding.  Once I found out you can work remotely from home or really anymore on earth where there is
            a wifi connection, I said,"Hold up.  This is for me!"  I wouldn't mind working from a traditional Cuban cafe in Miami one week,
            and the next week working from a family-owned neighborhood cafe in the heart of Brooklyn.  I truely believe by coding remotely, I
            can make this dream a reality!  More as like a side hustle, I've also started my own record label, called Flatspot Records.</p>
